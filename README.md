# Dartin' With Friends

This application was inspired by two things I love in life, coding, and playing darts.  

Darts With Friends is an ASP.Net Web MVC application that allows people to have an easy place to go for keeping score in their darting matches. This program utilizes n-tier architecture and BootStrap Razor Pages.
